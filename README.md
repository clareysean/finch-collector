# Finch Collector - Django Portfolio Project

Finch Collector is a web application built using Django that allows users to manage finch data, including adding new finches to a database and updating sightings and associated foods for the finches. This project demonstrates my abilities in building a Django-based web application with database integration, user authentication, and CRUD functionality.

## Features

- Finch Management: Users can add new finches to the database, view finch details, update finch information, and delete finches.
- Sightings and Foods: Users can log sightings for each finch, and associate them with specific foods.
- Food Management: Users can manage the list of available foods, including adding, updating, and deleting food items.
- Database Integration: The project uses PostgreSQL to store and manage finch, sighting, and food data.
- Responsive Design: The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clareysean/finch-collector.git
